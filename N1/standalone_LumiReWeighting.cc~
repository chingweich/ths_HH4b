   \class    standalone_LumiReWeighting standalone_LumiReWeighting.h "PhysicsTools/Utilities/interface/standalone_LumiReWeighting.h"
   \brief    Class to provide lumi weighting for analyzers to weight "flat-to-N" MC samples to data

   This class will trivially take two histograms:
   1. The generated "flat-to-N" distributions from a given processing (or any other generated input)
   2. A histogram generated from the "estimatePileup" macro here:

   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/LumiCalc#How_to_use_script_estimatePileup

   and produce weights to convert the input distribution (1) to the latter (2).
