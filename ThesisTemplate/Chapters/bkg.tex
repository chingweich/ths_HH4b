\chapter{Background Estimation} \label{Background}
In this channel whose final state are four b-flavor jets, main background contribution comes from multi-jet events.
The background estimation in the study combines two method used in 2015 research: alphabet and bump hunt into alphabet assisted bump hunt.
Alphabet assume the background is homogenously distributed on the two-dimension histogram.
The histogram is sepearted into signal region where signal most disbute and sideband region. 

\section{Alphabet Assisted Bump Hunt}
The two background estimation methods, alphabet and bump hunt, use orthogonal information from data.
While bump hunt drive in signal region, alphabet extrapolate from data in side band region. 
Therefore, we can combine two method into alphabet assisted bump hunt.

The estimation is inplemented as follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define a tagging and anti-tagging region. the double-b tagger working point is used as a discriminator here.
\item Derive the ratio of number of events in tagging region to that of anti-tagging region, which referred below $" R_{p\/f} "$.
\item The dependence of $R_{p/f}$ on $M_{jj}$ and that on $M_{Higgs Jet}$ are considered, while the latter is small enough to be ignored. The shape and the numbner of estimated background can be get from:
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
Bkg(M_{jj})= R_{p/f}(M_{jj}) \times Anti-tag(M_{jj})
\end{split}
\end{equation}
It can be further reduced to 
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
R_{p/f}(M_{jj})= 1+(M_{jj} \times lin_{par})
Bkg(M_{jj})= (1+(M_{jj} \times lin_{par})) \times Anti-tag(M_{jj})
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the parameters in Bkg($M_{jj}$) are initialized the same as Anti-tag($M_{jj}$), and $lin_{par}$ is a parameter of the linear dependence on $M_{jj}$
\item  The function Bkg($M_{jj}$) fits on the data in signal region to finish a post-fit procedure. 

\end{itemize}
