  \item Luminosity: Intergrated luminosity is estimated with 2.5$\% $ uncertainty. 
  \item Pile-ups: Pile-up efficiecny scale factor is applied to simulation weight the pile-up distribution as that of data. The pile-up distribution of data is measured by assuming minibios cross section equals to 69.2 mb, which has 4.6$\% $ uncertainty.  
  \item Double-b tagging:

  \item $\tau _{21}$ scale factor: The uncertainty of $\tau _{21}$ scale factor is measured by JME POG on the samples of semi-leptonic $t\bar{t}$ which is a generous source of W boson. The uncertainty of scale factor in the region $\tau _{21} <$ 0.55 is 14$\% $ per jet.
